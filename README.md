uniqueBloom
===========

Output unique DNA reads. It uses https://github.com/bitly/dablooms. It currently only supports fastq but I could be convinced to make a BAM version.

Usage 
./uniqueseqBloom [fastq file] [temp file]
the [temp file] can be whatever you wish, just pick a file you can write to
